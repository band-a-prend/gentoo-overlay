  <longdescription>
    The SU2 suite is an open-source collection of C++ based software tools
    for performing Partial Differential Equation (PDE) analysis and solving
    PDE-constrained optimization problems.

    The toolset is designed with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
    and aerodynamic shape optimization in mind, but is extensible
    to treat arbitrary sets of governing equations such as potential flow,
    elasticity, electrodynamics, chemically-reacting flows, and many others.
